Starting work on this stuff after all.

I created a script to populate the database with dummy data, but it seems that won't cut it for tests.

I'm writing another with a small collection of the ones I know and will test with.

server.py contains stuff I describe as "as simple as simple gets" and that is the case.
My priority here is getting something that works: i.e responds to requests online. I need to mess around with Azure's hosting, as well as get the basics of connecting a bot service to my api.. we'll move on from there.
