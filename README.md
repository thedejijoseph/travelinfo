## Travel Info

"A directory of information on interstate travel in Nigeria" is how I've described this project/idea.

Q: Where do I get a bus to Benin from Bauchi?

A: You would not be able to get a bus going there directly. You need to take a bus from Gidan Mai park to Tambari park in Abuja. You'd get buses going to Benin from there.
